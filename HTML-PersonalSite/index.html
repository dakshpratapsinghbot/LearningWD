      Naruto Uzumaki becomes the 7th Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village
      (Konohagakure) in the Naruto series. After years of hard work,
      determination, and countless battles, Naruto finally achieves his dream of
      becoming Hokage, following in the footsteps of his mentors and
      predecessors. Wears a traditional Hokage cloak and hat with the Kanji for
      "Seventh" (七代目). Oversees the protection and administration of the
      village. Is one of the strongest shinobi, having mastered powerful
      techniques like Sage Mode, the Rasengan, and the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.
      Works towards maintaining peace in the shinobi world, including helping
      rebuild relationships between the Hidden Leaf and other villages. His role
      as Hokage is central in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, where he faces
      the challenges of balancing his duties as leader with his responsibilities
      as a father to Boruto and Himawari.
